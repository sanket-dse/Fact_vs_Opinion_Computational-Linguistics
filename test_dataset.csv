"A key debate after the enactment of three farm-reform laws and the subsequent protests is around the issue of federally-fixed minimum support prices (MSPs), a system guaranteeing farmers assured prices for their produce through procurement. MSP is an obligatory, not a statutory exercise. Farmers have demanded a legislation to prohibit sale of any farm produce below these minimum prices. If the government agrees to this, it is likely they will end their protests against the three new farm reforms.But a law making MSPs the legal floor price defies economic logic. The government sets MSPs for 23 crops, but it is effective only in case of rice and wheat because it buys only these two commodities in sufficiently large quantities. MSPs are an assurance that the government will intervene if market rates fall below that threshold, thereby helping avoid distress sale. This policy was salutary when India faced acute food shortages. Farm policies to deal with surpluses will fundamentally have to be different from measures adopted to overcome a previous era of scarcity. A law barring purchases of the other 21 crops below MSPs by any private trader will also, immediately, fuel high inflation. Every one percentage point increase in MSPs leads to a 15-basis point increase in inflation. Higher MSPs could also upend the Reserve Bank of India’s inflation targets, hurting economic growth. An MSP mechanism that ignores demand and global prices creates market distort-ions. If it is not profitable for traders to buy at MSPs, then the private sector will exit the markets. In such a scenario, the government cannot be a monopoly buyer. Mandatory MSPs will render India’s agri- exports non-competitive because the government’s assured prices are way higher than both domestic and international market prices.MSPs have also incentivised foodgrains over other crops, giving rise to imbalances of water and land resources and shifting land away from crops such as pulses and oilseeds, necessitating costly imports. Surplus cereals can’t be exported without a subsidy, which invites the World Trade Organization (WTO)’s objections. WTO rules cap government procurement for subsidised food programmes by developing countries at 10% of the total value of agricultural production based on 1986-88 prices in dollar terms. There is no argument that farmers need support, but policies that are less distortionary are in the interest of both farmers and consumers.",opinion
"As the contribution of renewable energy (RE) in electricity supply increases, proportionally fewer coal plants may be needed. The ones that remain will have to operate more flexibly to accommodate the varying nature of RE. Most coal plants were not designed to operate this way. In addition, there are regulations to clean up coal power by retrofitting equipment for pollution control. The problem is that all three aspects — retirement of older plants, pollution control equipment, and making plants more flexible — are being planned in isolation. By thinking at a systemic level, we can address all three aspects at a lower cost, with better public health outcomes.At a national level, there is excess generating capacity. This has provided the rationale for several studies recommending early retirement of older coal plants, mostly using a plant age of 25 years as the threshold. These studies suggest replacing the energy from these older plants by RE or energy from newer, and presumably more efficient, coal plants that have not been able to run to full capacity. The ministry of environment, forest and climate change (MoEFCC)’s emissions norms require emissions control systems (ECS) for oxides of sulphur (SOx), nitrogen (NOx) and other pollutants. While there are fewer details on regulations or rules for making coal plants more flexible, many utilities are working on doing so.
There are several problems with this approach. First, these three issues are being looked at in isolation and second, simple binary rules are being recommended to address each. On the issue of excess capacity, the extent varies across the country. Most studies examine only aggregate utilisation of coal plants, their Plant Load Factor (PLF), which misses the value of output at peak times. This is key for a high-RE future. It is also not clear how long this excess capacity will last; decisions to either add or retire generation capacity should be based on long-term considerations. One advantage of older plants is that they are fully depreciated and thus have much lower fixed costs than newer plants. The issue of retirement of older plants is intertwined with the need for flexibility because older plants, which are of sub-critical technology design, are more suitable for flexible operations. In addition, if a distribution company that has no excess capacity has to run some plants at low PLF, then it is economically better for it to retain older plants with low fixed costs in its portfolio rather than contract for supply from a newer plant.The issues of pollution control and requirements for flexibility are also inter-related. We will confine ourselves to control of emissions of SOx because this is the pollutant which is currently most contentious. Flue Gas Desulphurization (FGD) is the most commonly-used technology to control SOx. Operating a plant with FGD in flexible mode makes the operation of FGD more challenging, likely requiring augmentation of the control and instrumentation systems, and possibly hardware changes, increasing costs and complexity.
The current emissions control approach relies on a one-size-fits-all policy. A recent study found that the health benefits from FGD varied greatly by location, with the highest benefit being 28 times that in the location with the lowest benefit. The Central Electricity Authority (CEA) recently carried out a study to examine the issue of plant-location specific emission standards instead of a uniform standard, and has recommended segregation of areas by the level of ambient SOx into five categories and that pollution control be required only in the two categories with higher SOx levels. One gap in the CEA’s study is that it did not consider secondary particulates due to SOx emissions. More nuanced installation of FGD based on plant location-specific environmental conditions plus expected duty cycle can save a significant amount of money. However, the implementation of such an approach will be challenging given the difficulties in monitoring compliance in India.As we have seen, the three issues — retirement, pollution control, and making plants flexible — are inter-related. They need to be addressed in an integrated fashion by distribution companies based on long-term system-level considerations of demand, supply and availability of new technologies. Distribution companies should be best placed to make these decisions because they are responsible for power procurement and additions or retirements of generation capacity from their portfolio.
As electricity markets become more effective, the true value of flexibility, the value of RE, and the need for capacity adequacy will become better known. This will make it easier for the distribution companies to make decisions about the optimal plan for retirements, making plants flexible, and installing FGDs. Therefore, rather than issuing rules on these issues in isolation, the government should focus on accelerating the introduction of effective electricity markets that provide the right signals for stakeholders to both invest in, but also operate plants once built, in the most cost-effective and clean manner.",opinion
"After years of flirting with politics and dropping hints about his own political ambitions, Rajinikanth, Tamil cinema’s biggest living icon – he remains that, although he has competition from some of the younger actors -- has finally announced that he will launch his own political party in January. Timed with the state assembly elections scheduled for next summer, his entry will create a new dynamic in a state where the line between art, stardom and politics has always been blurred.The Dravidian political movement saw a range of figures — CN Annadurai and M Karunanidhi, both established writers; MG Ramachandran, the tallest Tamil actor of his time; Jayalalithaa, the Karnataka-born Brahmin actor who built on MGR’s legacy — who straddled these diverse worlds. In recent times, Kamal Haasan and Vijayakanth have made unsuccessful forays into the political theatre. But, Rajnikanth’s cult following places him in a different category. The issue, however, for the new entrant is that that there are certain entrenched patterns and players within state politics, hard to challenge and harder to displace.
How he navigates the cross currents of deep identity-based resentment against the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) in the state with his own perceived proximity to the party with which he is widely expected to ally; how he builds a new party organisation to take on the well-oiled machines of the Dravida Munnetra Kazhagam and the All India Anna Dravida Munnetra Kazhagam; how he distinguishes himself in what is already a crowded political landscape with a range of smaller players catering to diverse sub-castes; and how he delivers a message of bringing change will be the key determinants of his political future.But there is little doubt that irrespective of whether he succeeds or not, Rajinikanth’s entry will shape the nature of politics in an important state that sends 39 MPs to the Lok Sabha.",opinion
"Are these really farmers who are blocking the roads and protesting? It’s a quizzical question often asked on news TV by many who rarely step out of studios. They are Congress-sponsored groups, claim government spokespersons; they are Khalistani sympathisers, suggest the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP)’s social media warriors.The first theory can be easily countered. If the Congress had the resources and organisational might to sponsor a farmers’ movement for even a week, the party wouldn’t be reduced to 52 Members of Parliament (MPs). To demonise the protesting farmers as Khalistanis is more unfortunate. It reveals a mindset that seeks to stereotype any anti-government protest as anti-national. The Punjabi Jat farmer’s attachment to land is a bit like the Gujarati middle class community’s connection to the stock market: Bring in a stock-market reform that sparks off fears over future profits and watch the reaction in Surat. A handful of people speaking in support of Jarnail Singh Bhindranwale’s bloodied legacy is hardly reason enough to label a movement of farmer unions as being driven by Sikh separatism.So then, who are these protesters braving winter temperatures and police water cannons and gheraoing Delhi? What if one suggested that they are ordinary citizens worried about a new legal framework that could disrupt their traditional working system? It isn’t as if these farmers are impoverished. The average landholding in Punjab is 3.7 hectares, well above the national average. It isn’t as if the new farm laws will destroy their lives; instead, the reforms can benefit farmers by eliminating middlemen. It’s just that there was a stark unilateral edge to the Centre’s decision to bring in laws that could change Punjab’s well-entrenched mandi system of crop sale and purchase.
The manner in which farm reforms were pushed through a brute majority in Parliament, with almost no consultation with stakeholders, lies at the root of the confrontation. Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s predecessors — PV Narasimha Rao, AB Vajpayee, Manmohan Singh — were constrained by the absence of a majority and had to reform by stealth or consensus. The Modi model is built around a strongman-State that issues firmans with no dialogue with the parties concerned. Then, be it a hugely disruptive move such as demonetisation or a grandiose vision like the Central Vista project, there is little space for any pre-decision conversation. Recall also the revocation of Article 370 in Jammu and Kashmir or the passage of the Citizenship (Amendment) Act.In each instance, dissenting voices were stifled, even criminalised. Little attempt was made to strike up a dialogue with protesters; they were not seen as the BJP’s vote bank.
By contrast, farmers are a crucial vote bank. Modi makes it a point to reach out to the garib-kisan in almost every speech. The Centre’s media machine repeatedly points out how the government has hiked the Minimum Support Price (MSP) and provided small and marginal farmers ₹6,000 annual income support under the PM-Kisan scheme. There is also no doubt that a large number of farmers have voted for the BJP in elections. Punjab is an exception here since it is the one north Indian state that has resisted the Modi wave since 2014.It is the recognition that any kind of farmer revolt can spiral out of control that has forced the government to the dialogue table. A protest which begins in Punjab can easily spread to neighbouring BJP-ruled Haryana, and indeed to other states with large and restive farm populations. Political leaders in the Kashmir Valley can be jailed, student activists from a Jawaharlal Nehru University can be browbeaten, the Shaheen Bagh women can be threatened with goli maaro rhetoric, but an angry and restless farmer must be assuaged.
Which is why the events of the last week perhaps provide a clue to where the real opposition to the Modi government’s dominance lies. It doesn’t lie in a weak political Opposition whose leaders struggle to go beyond Twitter debates. It doesn’t lie in institutions that have been weakened over time. It doesn’t lie in a media which has, with a few exceptions, lost the capacity to tell truth to power. It doesn’t lie in urban elites hypnotised by political Hindutva and a larger-than-life leadership to even question blunders such as demonetisation.The opposition to governments that rule by decree lies in sizeable groups of ordinary Indians who do not like being taken for granted. Modi is by far the most popular leader in the country. But personal popularity does not guarantee permanent support on each issue. A more consensual approach is sometimes needed to remove anxieties when initiating far-reaching reforms. A one-sided diktat is no answer when people need to be first comforted and convinced into acceptance of a new law.
Post-script: While the Delhi-centric media’s attention has been focused on the farm agitation, citizen groups in south Goa have been holding day and night protests against infrastructure projects that threaten the state’s fragile and invaluable forests and wildlife sanctuaries. In a land of a million mutinies, citizen power is the best antidote to executive overreach.",opinion
"The Reserve Bank of India (RBI), the sentinel of our banking system having occasionally faltered as the supreme banking regulator, is often seen to be working in tandem with the government. Perhaps that is the reason why some suspect that its recent recommendation that pave the way for industrial houses to own and control banks may well have originated from a government which realises that public sector banks lack the capacity to provide credit to meet the growing needs of industry; that the supply of credit is unlikely to match its demand.Public sector banks with the baggage of non-performing assets (NPAs) have limited space to lend. Consequently, more banking and financial institutions are needed to serve the demands of industrial enterprises.
Ever since demonetisation in 2016, the economy’s steep downturn has been a cause for concern. With the onslaught of the Covid-19 pandemic, its crippling effect is being felt in almost every sector of the economy other than those that use technology and digital platforms for providing goods and services.
Several sectors of the economy are in dire need of credit. Public sector banks are reluctant to advance them credit for obvious reasons. Apart from the norms of RBI, the Kamath Committee’s parameters for restructuring of loans will lead to large sections of business enterprises being deprived of credit. Given these parameters, the State Bank of India, the largest lender among public sector banks, may restructure barely 5% of distressed borrowers. Public sector banks are averse to risk-lending. Bank officers, being easy targets, are concerned about becoming victims in future at the hands of the Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI). No bank is likely to extend credit unless the loan is fully secured by collateral, the value of which gives absolute comfort to the bank. There is hardly any sector of the economy which has assets, in the midst of the pandemic, to provide enough security for advancing credit. The most badly-hit sectors are road construction, real estate, housing and hospitality, manufacturing and tourism, among others. These sectors provide maximum employment opportunities for the less privileged. Ironically, these are also the sectors that are starved of credit.A few large corporate houses control a substantial part of our national assets. We are seeing the rise of economic oligarchs in key sectors of the economy. The perception gaining ground is that a few close to this government are patronised by public sector banks which provide them the much-needed capital in the form of credit to acquire assets critical for our future needs. If industrial houses are licensed to set up banks, they will ensure that a large part of the credit goes to their “relative subsidiaries and other connected enterprises”. RBI does not have the wherewithal to oversee every such banking transaction. Experiments in other countries allowing industrial houses to set up banks have failed miserably. The United States (US) does not allow corporate houses to set up banks. It violates the principle of conflict of interest and can, on no account, be justified.Given the fact that industrial houses already control critical assets in our economy, to allow them to set up banks will make them even more powerful. A democratic country cannot afford to have its economy being controlled by a few powerful industrial houses which also have a huge stake in the banking system.
Of deeper concern is the public perception that these industrial houses are close to the ruling establishment. The electoral bonds which have been issued are seen to be contributions by such corporate houses to the political party in power. This gives rise to the suspicion that in the event they are allowed to set up banks, lending too will be targeted to benefit businesses and individual borrowers associated with or close to the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP). Inherent in such a situation is rampant discrimination in the flow of credit which, in turn, will build compliant businesses and destroy non-compliant enterprises.We have seen in the past how scams have occurred within the banking system. The scandals emerging from suspect banking practices in Yes Bank, ICICI Bank, Infrastructure Leasing & Financial Services Limited (IL&FS), Dewan Housing Financial Corporation Limited (DHFL) and many others, including individuals being investigated, have discredited both the banking system and the manner in which it is regulated. RBI’s oversight mechanisms are clearly not effective enough. The practices within the Non-Banking Financial Companies (NBFCs) have also left much to be desired.
It is imperative for RBI to consider other mechanisms to expand lending to businesses. The expansion of NBFCs under strict regulatory mechanisms is one option, but the heart of the problems lies in the direct and indirect influences that operate within our banking structure which need course correction. Unless the banking system adheres to strict parameters guided by best practices, the possibility of the banking system turning around and providing for much-needed credit to the industry is bleak.That RBI has made such a recommendation despite the contrary opinion of the expert committee, is disturbing. RBI must justify its decision with unequivocal logic before it embarks upon this enterprise. Otherwise, it will not only compromise its own dignity and independence, but will also be charged with being a dependent, rather than an independent, banking regulator.",opinion
"The South Korean industrial giant is working with the U.S. Consumer Product Safety Commission on the recall after the company received reports of five fires with its battery systems that caused limited property damage and no injuries, according to a recall notice seen by Bloomberg.
LG Energy Solution Co., formed this month after LG moved to split off its energy storage and electric-vehicle battery business, is working with related companies to determine the cause, it said in an emailed statement. The recall is voluntary and customers will be offered free replacements of some batteries as a preemptive measure, the company said.The impacted units were sold by various distributors of solar energy systems including Sunrun Inc. from January 2017 through March 2019, the recall notice said. Cells in units being recalled are at risk of overheating, according to the notice.
Sunrun confirmed the recall and said it affects about 5% of its Brightbox customers.
“We have already started proactively replacing batteries impacted by the recall and have credited customers for the brief downtime,” Sunrun spokesman Wyatt Semanek in an email.
The recall comes at a time when many solar installers are offering batteries as part of their systems. Many homeowners now seek backup power to protect themselves from electrical outages due to hurricanes, extreme heat or the threat of wildfires.
LG Chem supplied batteries to an energy storage facility owned by an Arizona Public Service utility that exploded last year and caused several injuries. The utility said the fire was caused by a defective cell. LG Chem disputed those findings.",fact

"The eight-month Covid lockdown restrictions have been a boom time for e-commerce companies with traditional traders seeing a worse-than-expected slide in business.
Now traditional traders have teamed up to developed their own e-commerce local application and reach out to consumers.Sachin Nivangune, president, Pune district retail traders’ association, said, “We are developing e-commerce websites as well as applications to reach out to consumers and deliver products at their doorsteps, besides providing attractive discounts. The Confederation of All India Traders (CAIT) is helping us to develop an application.”
Devendra Sarda, chief executive officer of online supermarket store Picodel said, “We cater to a wide range of products, including grocery, fruits, vegetables, sweets, chicken, cosmetics and medicines and deliver to customers’ doorsteps through 200 shops. At present, we are starting our service at Kharadi and Magarpatta areas on an experimental basis. Our order delivery time is within one and a half hours. We have decided to compete them major e-commerce firms by going online.”Vijay Narela, trader and managing director of Bhartiya-Dukan (B-Dukan) application developed to bring traders under one roof, said, “E-commerce companies have badly affected our business. We are developing an app that will provide customers cash back, discounts and other offers like other e-commerce companies.”CAIT, a leading advocate for small traders and business in country, has appealed to traders and their organisations to collect information from their respective areas, create database and connect to promote their businesses. The database should also cover various organisations, social, cultural and religious bodies, clubs, schools, colleges, hospitals, hotels, temples and nursing homes. The information will help traders reach out to their neighbourhood as per their needs and demands.Rajendra Batiya, executive chairman, Maharashtra wing of CAIT said, “We are collecting information on different types of organisations so that we can connect with them. In the coming days, we will provide training to traders on how to run e-commerce business. We will also organise a statewide seminar on e-commerce challenge and solutions.”“Connecting traders with consumers in a cohesive manner and giving the latter a right to choose a product coupled with reasonable price and efficient delivery system will benefit the stakeholders,” said Batiya.",fact
"Four men have been arrested and valuables worth Rs 19,65,000 were recovered by the the Pimpri- Chinchwad crime branch officials on Thursday, according to Krishna Prakash, commissioner, Pimpri- Chinchwad police.The four have been identified as Chandrakant alias SM Anant Mane (27) and Raju Shambhu Devnath Raju Bangali (20), both residents of Vetal nagar in Chinchwad; Ram alias Ramjane Lakshman Ksshirsagar (26), a resident of Wagholi in Kalamb taluka of Osmanabad; and Amol alias Bhelya Arun Male alias Ghuge (27), a resident of Chinchwade nagar in Chinchwad.

"The Centre for Science and Environment (CSE) on Friday handed over to the Food Safety and Standards Authority of India (FSSAI) a sample of the fructose adulterant, which can beat existing quality and safety tests, used by leading brands and other documents that were part of its investigation into honey adulteration.The FSSAI had sought samples and other evidence. The CSE shared the sample of fructose syrup, which is called “all-pass” in the market procured from a company in Jaspur. It also provided full correspondence with two Chinese companies from which CSE procured adulterant samples along with details of the consignment of adulterant sent by a company in China that CSE could not eventually receive because it did not have necessary permits.
On Wednesday, CSE made public the findings of its investigation into honey adulteration. The probe found that 77% of samples from 13 top honey brands were adulterated with a modified sugar syrup to beat safety tests. CSE found that some Chinese companies developed a syrup containing fructose, or fruit sugar, that can go undetected in Indian tests for the purity of honey.A CSE statement said its representatives met FSSAI officials including chairperson Rita Teotia and CEO Arun Singhal. It added the authority has assured that they will send the adulterant sample for further testing and will also follow up on all the contacts and details CSE has provided to unravel the adulteration nexus. Based on its review, FSSAI has said it will take the necessary steps to amend the food standards and step-up surveillance.
FSSAI on Thursday responded to the expose and said CSE found the adulterants by using the non-prescription Trace Marker for Rice (TMR) syrup test instead of a more sensitive Specific Marker for Rice (SMR) syrup test. “It is not clear as to why some tests like SMR have not been conducted on the samples spiked with adulterants by CSE. FSSAI has requested details of the samples and the tests conducted from CSE. As soon as details become available, they will be analysed by FSSAI to draw conclusions about the protocols followed and suggest any improvements that are required in the test methodology for future,” FSSAI said in a statement on Thursday.On Friday, FSSAI representatives inquired why CSE had not asked for SMR in the samples deliberately spiked by CSE to expose adulteration. CSE sent the spiked samples to National Dairy Development Board laboratory in Gujarat for testing.
FSSAI officials said SMR was required to detect adulteration by rice syrup. CSE has explained that this was not the globally understood laboratory test practice.
CSE has stressed that the ring of adulteration needed to be firmly dealt with and that FSSAI must take urgent steps to stop or break the nexus. “Our research has clearly established that samples adulterated even up to 50% can bypass our testing for C3 and C4 sugar [(cane or high fructose corn syrup],” said Sunita Narain, director general, CSE.“We will send samples for further investigations,” said an FSSAI spokesperson.",fact
